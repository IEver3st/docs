## Model Issues

### "Model failed to load"
- **Cause**: The file might be corrupted or in an unsupported format version.
- **Fix**: Try opening the file in CodeWalker to verify it is valid. If it opens there but not in Cortex, please report a bug.

### "Rainbow/Psychedelic Colors"
- **Cause**: This usually happens when loading 16-bit PSDs in viewers that don't support them, or when vertex colors are incorrectly rendered.
- **Fix**:
  - **PSDs**: Cortex Labs v3+ supports 16-bit PSDs natively. Ensure you are on the latest version.
  - **Models**: If a `.ydd` model looks tinted (magenta/yellow), Cortex Labs automatically disables vertex colors in EUP mode. Try reloading the model.

### "OBJ files not working"
- **Cause**: OBJ support is intentionally disabled.
- **Fix**: Use `.yft` or `.ydd` files directly from the game or mod archive.

## Texture Issues

### "Invalid Signature" error on save
- **Cause**: When saving a large PSD in Photoshop, the file might be briefly empty (0 bytes) or locked while writing.
- **Fix**: Cortex Labs includes a retry mechanism. If you see this error, wait a moment; it usually resolves itself on the next retry attempt (within milliseconds).

### Texture not updating
- **Cause**: The file watcher might have lost the handle.
- **Fix**: Re-select the texture file in the sidebar to re-attach the watcher.

## Performance

### Slow rendering / lag
- **Cause**: High-poly models (500k+ polygons) or 4K/8K uncompressed textures.
- **Fix**:
  - Close other GPU-heavy applications.
  - Resize textures to 2K for preview purposes if 4K is causing stutter.
  - Use `.clmesh` cache files if available (generated automatically after first load).
