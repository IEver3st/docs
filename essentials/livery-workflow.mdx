This guide outlines the recommended workflow for creating vehicle liveries using Cortex Labs.

## Setup

1.  **Prepare your Workspace**:
    - Open your image editor (Photoshop, Paint.NET, GIMP).
    - Open Cortex Labs.
    - Arrange your windows so you can see both simultaneously (or use a second monitor).

2.  **Load Assets**:
    - Drag your vehicle model (`.yft`) into Cortex Labs.
    - Open the livery template (`.png` or `.psd`) in your image editor.
    - Drag the same texture file into Cortex Labs' "Texture" slot.

## Real-Time Editing

Cortex Labs watches the file system for changes to the loaded texture.

1.  **Make a Change**: Draw a line, place a logo, or change a color in your image editor.
2.  **Save (Ctrl+S)**: Overwrite the file on disk.
3.  **Instant Preview**: Cortex Labs will detect the change and reload the texture on the 3D model instantly (usually <100ms).

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: If using Photoshop, you can save directly to `.psd`. Cortex Labs supports reading flattened PSD composites, so you don't need to export to PNG every time you want to preview.
</Tip>

## Material Targeting

When loading a vehicle, Cortex Labs tries to guess which materials are "paint" or "liveries".

- **Livery Mode**:
  - Automatically targets materials named `carpaint`, `sign_1`, `livery`, etc.
  - Keeps windows, tires, and chrome unchanged.
  - Best for standard livery work.

- **Everything Mode**:
  - Applies the texture to **every** mesh in the model.
  - Useful for debugging UV maps or if the auto-detection misses a specific part.

## Exporting

Once you are happy with your livery:

1.  **Final Save**: Save your project file (`.psd`).
2.  **Export**: Export the final texture as `.dds` (DXT5 or DXT1) or `.png` for use in OpenIV/CodeWalker.
    - *Note: Cortex Labs is a previewer, not a .ytd editor. You still need OpenIV or Texture Toolbox to import the texture into the game files.*
