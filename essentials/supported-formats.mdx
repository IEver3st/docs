Cortex Labs supports a wide range of asset formats used in the FiveM and GTA V modding community.

## 3D Models

### Vehicle Formats
- **.yft** (Fragment): Standard GTA V vehicle model format. Cortex Labs converts these internally to renderable geometry.
- **.dff** (RenderWare): Older GTA format, supported for legacy compatibility.
- **.obj** (Wavefront): **Not Supported**.
  <Warning>
    OBJ files are intentionally unsupported out of respect for vehicle developers and to prevent unauthorized ripping/editing of locked assets.
  </Warning>

### Character/EUP Formats
- **.ydd** (Drawable Dictionary): Supported for EUP (Emergency Uniforms Pack) clothing previews.
  - Automatically loads the highest detail level (High/Med/Low).
  - Supports 16-bit vertex formats common in newer assets.

### Cache Formats
- **.clmesh**: Cortex Labs' internal mesh cache format. Speeds up loading for previously opened models.

## Textures

Cortex Labs supports mostly all standard image formats, plus direct support for modding formats.

| Format | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **.png** | Recommended for high quality and transparency. |
| **.jpg / .jpeg** | Standard compressed images. |
| **.dds** | DirectDraw Surface. Native texture format for GTA V. Supports DXT1, DXT3, DXT5 compression. |
| **.psd** | Adobe Photoshop Document. **Includes 16-bit support.** |
| **.tga** | Truevision TGA. |
| **.tiff** | Tagged Image File Format. |
| **.webp** | Modern web format. |

### 16-bit PSD Support
Cortex Labs includes a specialized decoder for **16-bit PSD files**, which are common in high-quality livery templates.
- Automatically converts 16-bit data to 8-bit for display.
- Supports RAW, RLE (PackBits), and ZIP compression modes.
- Prevents the "psychedelic" or "rainbow" artifacts seen in other viewers when loading 16-bit assets.
