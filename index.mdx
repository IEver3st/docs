## What is Cortex Labs?

**Cortex Labs** (formerly Cortex Studio) is a standalone desktop application designed to streamline the workflow for GTA V and FiveM livery creators. It allows you to load 3D models (`.yft`, `.ydd`) and preview texture changes in real-time as you edit them in Photoshop or other image editors.

The application is built with **Tauri v2**, **React**, and **Three.js**, ensuring high performance and a native feel on Windows.

## Key Features

- **Live Reloading**: Automatically updates the model texture whenever you save your work in Photoshop/GIMP/Paint.NET.
- **Model Support**:
  - **Vehicles**: Supports `.yft` fragment files (converted locally to `.dff` for rendering).
  - **EUP / Clothing**: Supports `.ydd` drawable dictionary files for clothing previews.
- **Smart Targeting**:
  - **Livery Mode**: Automatically detects vehicle body paint, signs, and decals.
  - **Everything Mode**: Allows targeting any mesh in the model.
- **Visuals**:
  - PBR-like rendering with configurable metalness/roughness.
  - 16-bit PSD support (automatically converted for preview).
  - Custom background and body colors.
