## Installation

Cortex Labs is a portable application. You can download the latest release from GitHub.

### Steps

1.  **Download**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/IEver3st/cortex-labs/releases) page.
2.  **Extract**: Download the `.zip` or `.msi` installer.
3.  **Run**: Launch `Cortex Labs.exe`.

<Note>
  Cortex Labs is currently Windows-only due to its reliance on FiveM/GTA V asset formats and Windows-specific tools.
</Note>

## Your First Preview

Once installed, follow these steps to preview a livery:

1.  **Launch Cortex Labs**.
2.  **Load a Model**: Drag and drop a `.yft` (vehicle) or `.ydd` (clothing) file into the window.
3.  **Load a Texture**: Click the "Texture" slot in the sidebar and select your livery file (`.png`, `.dds`, `.psd`).
4.  **Edit & Save**: Open the texture in Photoshop, make changes, and hit Save. Cortex Labs will instantly update the 3D model.
