Cortex Labs is built with **Tauri v2**, **React**, **Vite**, and **Three.js**.

## Prerequisites

- **Bun**: Required for package management and scripts.
- **Rust**: Required for Tauri backend.
- **Node.js**: Required for some build tools (though Bun handles most).
- **C++ Build Tools**: Required for native modules on Windows (Visual Studio Build Tools).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IEver3st/cortex-labs.git
    cd cortex-labs
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## Running Locally

To run the full desktop application in development mode:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

This will:
1.  Start the Vite frontend dev server (localhost:1420).
2.  Compile the Rust backend.
3.  Launch the Tauri application window.

### UI-Only Mode

If you only want to work on the React UI (and don't need native file system features):

```bash
bun run dev
```

<Note>
  In UI-only mode, features like file loading, saving, and native dialogs will not work or will use mock data.
</Note>

## Building

To create a production build (installer/executable):

```bash
bun run tauri build
```

The output will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: React frontend code.
  - `components/Viewer.jsx`: The core Three.js renderer and file parsers.
  - `lib/`: Utility libraries (YFT parser, helpers).
- `src-tauri/`: Rust backend code.
  - `src/lib.rs`: Main Rust logic (file watchers, commands).
- `tools/`: Sidecar executables (e.g., CodeWalker bridge).

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Style**: We use Prettier and ESLint. Run `bun run lint` before committing.
- **File Formats**: If adding support for a new format, please include a sample file in your PR description.
- **Performance**: Avoid blocking the main thread. Use Web Workers for heavy parsing (e.g., large geometry).
